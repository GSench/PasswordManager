# Password Manager

Simple open-source app for secure password storage.
It uses AES-Encryption with 256 bit key. This key is written by user as a password for opening app.

Main features:
  - Copy login/password by click in the app
  - Integrated random login/password generator
  - Create new password base or select existing one
  - Build-in keyboard (for better security)
  - Base access through PIN

Future features:
  - Beautiful design :-)
  - Settings
  - Passwords' categories
